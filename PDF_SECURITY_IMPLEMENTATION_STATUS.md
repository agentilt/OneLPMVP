# PDF Security Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Fixed

### 1. **PDFViewer Component** ‚úÖ
- **Updated** to support both fund documents and direct investment documents
- Added `documentType` prop to route to the correct proxy endpoint
- Automatically uses secure proxy when `documentId` is provided

### 2. **DirectInvestmentDetailClient** ‚úÖ
- **Fixed** to properly pass `documentId` and `documentType` to PDFViewer
- Now correctly uses the secure proxy endpoint for direct investment documents

### 3. **FundDetailClient** ‚úÖ
- Already correctly configured - passes `documentId` to use secure proxy
- No changes needed

## üîí Security Features Already in Place

Your application already has a robust secure document proxy system:

1. **Authentication Required**: All document access requires NextAuth session
2. **Permission Checks**: Validates user has access to the fund/direct investment
3. **Server-Side Fetching**: PDFs are fetched server-side (original URLs never exposed)
4. **Security Headers**: Documents served with proper security headers
5. **Audit Logging**: All access attempts (authorized and unauthorized) are logged

## üìã Next Steps You Need to Take

### Step 1: Verify Google Drive Document Setup (Required)

For PDFs to be viewable on `onelp.capital`, you need to ensure your Google Drive files are properly configured:

1. **Upload PDFs to Google Drive**
2. **Share settings**: For each PDF file, set sharing to:
   - "Anyone with the link" (View only) - **Required for public access**
   - OR use Google Drive API with service account (more secure, see Step 4)

3. **Get the shareable link**:
   - Format: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/{FILE_ID}/view?usp=sharing`
   - Use this URL when creating documents in your database

### Step 2: Test Document Viewing (Required)

Test PDF viewing in all contexts:

1. **Fund Documents**:
   - Navigate to a fund detail page (`/funds/[id]`)
   - Click "View PDF" on a document
   - Verify PDF loads in the modal viewer

2. **Direct Investment Documents**:
   - Navigate to a direct investment detail page (`/direct-investments/[id]`)
   - Click "View PDF" on a document
   - Verify PDF loads in the modal viewer

3. **Access Control Testing**:
   - Test with a user who has access (should work)
   - Test with a user who doesn't have access (should show 403 Forbidden)
   - Test without login (should show 401 Unauthorized)

### Step 3: Verify Google Drive URLs in Database

Ensure all document URLs in your database are correctly formatted:

- ‚úÖ Correct: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123xyz/view?usp=sharing`
- ‚ùå Incorrect: Direct download URLs (proxy handles conversion)

The proxy automatically converts Google Drive share links to direct download URLs:
- Input: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123xyz/view?usp=sharing`
- Converts to: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ABC123xyz`

### Step 4: (Optional) Enhanced Security with Google Drive API

For **private** Google Drive files (recommended for sensitive financial documents):

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**
2. **Enable Google Drive API**
3. **Create a Service Account** and download credentials JSON
4. **Add environment variables** to your `.env`:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
   ```
5. **Share files** with the service account email (View only)
6. **Update proxy endpoints** to use Google Drive API (see `SECURE_DOCUMENT_DISPLAY_GUIDE.md` lines 72-104)

### Step 5: Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to `onelp.capital`:

- [ ] Verify all Google Drive PDFs are shared correctly
- [ ] Test document viewing with real user accounts
- [ ] Verify audit logs are recording document access
- [ ] Test access control (unauthorized users cannot access documents)
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for secure document serving)
- [ ] Verify NextAuth session cookies are secure in production

## üîç Troubleshooting

### PDF Not Loading

**Issue**: PDF viewer shows error or blank screen

**Solutions**:
1. Check Google Drive sharing settings (must be "Anyone with the link")
2. Verify the URL format in database matches: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/{FILE_ID}/view?usp=sharing`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify user has proper access permissions
5. Check server logs for proxy errors

### 403 Forbidden Error

**Issue**: User sees "Access denied" when viewing documents

**Solutions**:
1. Verify user has `FundAccess` record for the fund
2. Check user's role (ADMIN and DATA_MANAGER have full access)
3. Verify user owns the fund/direct investment
4. For direct investments, verify user's `clientId` matches

### 502 Bad Gateway Error

**Issue**: Proxy cannot fetch PDF from Google Drive

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Google Drive file is accessible (try opening link in browser)
2. Check Google Drive sharing settings
3. Verify network connectivity from your server
4. Check if file has been deleted or moved

### Google Drive Conversion Issues

**Issue**: Proxy can't extract file ID from Google Drive URL

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure URL format is: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/{FILE_ID}/view?usp=sharing`
2. Verify FILE_ID is valid (alphanumeric with dashes/underscores)
3. Check server logs for URL parsing errors
